# list_item2.sh
# The second version of the list_item.sh script.
#
# This script slices a csv file on the row number generated by ./csv_search3.sh. 
# $1 should be the row number.
# $2 should be the csv file.
# The result is piped through sed 1d to remove the header row.
r=$(xsv slice -i $1 $2) 
echo $r | sed 1d
# A common use case would be to append the result to a new csv file, bound for
# copying into the ASpace bulk upload template.
# See `monitor_csv` for a related tool to track changes to the new csv file as
# you use ./list_item2.sh.
